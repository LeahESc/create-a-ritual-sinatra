### Ritual: A Personal Well-Being Application
Record your well-being rituals and habits to help enhance your mental, emotional and spiritual well-being. This application acts both as a record of all the tools and techniques that you have at your disposal to feel grounded and at-ease.

### Getting Started
Sign up with your name, email and password. Create new rituals in whatever categories you choose.
Once you've signed up (or logged in for returning users) you'll be able to view your personal rituals and their corresponding categories. You can create, view, edit, or delete any of your own rituals that you'd like. You will not be able to view another user's rituals or edit them because these are personal techniques.
